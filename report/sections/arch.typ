= Architecture <sec:arch>

Which network family should carry the policy and critic? Marco's MLP / LSTM / CNN / GNN ablation ranks graph ≈ LSTM > CNN > MLP at 2p. The graph net is also the smallest, and the only family that scales to any map, since it predicts board actions per node, edge and tile. Every other section uses `graph-s` (Canopy nexus-v3-style message passing, 541,540 parameters; @sec:recipe).

#tldr[One recipe and budget, 2p, against F: `graph-s` 90.7, `lstm` 90.3 (a coin flip head to head with `graph-s`), `cnn` 80.4, `mlp` 64.9. The graph net is also the smallest. One seed at 100M steps ranks the families but cannot separate graph from LSTM.]

*Question.* Which family is strongest under one recipe and budget?

*Setup.* The current recipe (@sec:recipe) at the `private` level, so the recurrent cell has hidden information to remember; one shared policy–critic trunk per cell. One seed, 100M agent steps (757 epochs): enough to separate families (`puffer-graph2` was at 86% against F by then). Besides `graph-s`:
/ `lstm`: `graph-s` plus an LSTM cell over its pooled embedding, stepped at the seat's own decisions (@sec:markov).
/ `cnn`: v1's xdim CNN on the v2 row (`src/catanrl/models/cnn.py`) at `xdim-default` size: 16.8M parameters, 15.1M in the projection after the convolutions. The blocks are gathered onto v1's 11 × 21 plane, laid out from the BASE map. Changes from v1: GroupNorm, not BatchNorm, so rollouts and evals run the same network (`norm: batch` restores v1); every block feature is a channel (47 at 2p, not 20 hand-picked planes); v2's structured heads. BASE map only (`hexagon` has another tile order and is refused).
/ `mlp`: A flat network over the padded row (`configs/models/mlp.yaml`), BASE dims only.

#lead[Reading.]
- The LSTM matches the graph net from epoch 300 on, at 1.6× the parameters and 0.85× the throughput: at this budget, memory over the seat's own decisions adds nothing the row lacks (at 4p it does, @sec:markov).
- The CNN, with 31× the parameters and a third of the speed, tracks ten points lower and loses two games in three to the graph net.
- The MLP never catches up (26 points behind, four losses in five): a cheap baseline only.

#repro(```sh
catanrl run configs/experiments/arch-ablation.yaml
# One cell: add --only graph-s (or mlp, cnn, lstm).
# Head-to-head finals need graph-s's best checkpoint, so the runner trains graph-s first.
```)

#tldr[Separating `graph-s` from `lstm` needs the full 500M-step budget and more seeds (Claude's suggestion, not queued).]

*Status.* Nothing run. The closest config, `configs/experiments/arch-lineage.yaml`, sweeps `graph-s`, `graph-m` and `mlp` over two seeds at 400M steps (6.5 h a cell; 12 cells, about a week of GPU). It ports v1's lineage script (`full` level, γ = 0.99, then γ = 1 from epoch 3000), not the current recipe, and has no `lstm` cell.
